# The EnviroMaster Module

The Klappir EnviroMaster is a SaaS solution (module) on the Core.Klappir.io platform designed to help you create strong infrastructure for smart environmental management and sustainability practices. By streaming or importing operational consumption data into the centralized database of the platform you create a more reliable and detailed overview of your operational footprint. The Dashboard, graphs and charts provide detailed insight and discovery you can then analyse for increasing your operational efficiency by reducing waste and excess consumption.

Streaming transactional consumption data into the Klappir Platform is the best means to ensure consistency, accuracy, and transparency in GHG accounting. By connecting to smart meters and sensors, as well as suppliers and service providers through APIs, user errors are reduced and costs of compiling the emissions inventory is greatly reduced.

Technically you can measure any type of operational consumption and waste production. But let’s start at the beginning to get the consumption data flowing into the system and identifying the assets generating the consumption and waste.

The EnviroMaster module icon is a leaf in the horizontal menu bar at the top of the page. The other icons in the menu bar are other Klappir solutions.

# The EnviroMaster Dashboard

EnviroMaster is a collection of all your consumption data presented in a user-friendly interface starting with the Klappir Dashboard. **Insights** is the menu item for EnviroMaster's Dashboard. Each category, side menu or on the Dashboard, are clickable and open the analytics for each.

![EnviroMaster Dashboard](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/EnviroMaster-Insights-Dashboard.png)

The Dashboard is a clear and comphrehensive overview of your total environmental footprint – that is, the overall sustainability of your operation. This unprecedented overview of your energy intensity should cover your whole business operation.

On the Dashboard you have bar charts for fuel, electricity, waste, hot and cold water, gaseous substances, and heating. Based on the data, we are then able to calculate the CO2 equivalents of your total emissions.

### tCO₂e - What are carbon equivalents?

Carbon dioxide equivalents, also written tCO₂e, is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. To give an example, metan (CH₄) equals 28 tCO₂e and nitrous oxide (N₂O) equals 265 28 tCO₂e.

![tCO2e Emisssions chart](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Carbon+equivalents.png)

The Klappir methodology is based on the three scopes defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The Dashboard displays emissions for all three scopes.

**Scope 1**: All direct emissions stemming from the activities of an organisation.

**Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation. Emissions are created during the production of the energy and eventually used by the organisation.

**Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions stemming from operational activities, for example through services provided by others. Staff flights are a good example.

# Insights

Insights is the term the Klappir EnviroMaster uses for the Analytics breakdowns. Each consumption category includes 3 tabs for the analytics:
  - Overview
  - Summary
  - Transactions
  
Each of these has a number of filters available for reviewing cumulative data for the year or comparison of specific assets energy intensity.

## Fuel

### Overview

The first tab view in your fuel consumption is the Overview and here you can deep dive into the fuel data and customise what is displayed on the Overview. The Overview displays the collection of bar graphs with pie charts for analysis. For convenience, you can select Date Range, Asset Types, Asset Groups, and Suppliers for comparison. You can also view your cumulative emissions throughout all the years you have data for.

![Overview chart of fuel consumption emissions](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Fuel-Overview.png)

This is a great tool for keeping track of how your goals for reducing your footprint are going and spot opportunities for improvement.

![Overview of fuel consumption graphs](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Fuel-Overview-Supplier.png)

Choose the date range you want to look at

![date range selection](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsDateRange.png)

and either view all assets or select asset type.

![aseet types selection](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAssetType.png)

You can also sort your assets into groups (e.g. by location or organisational structure)

![asset groups selection](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAssetGroups.png)

and view individual assets, such as specific vehicles.

![assets selection](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAllAssets.png)

The fun, however, is in customising what is displayed on the Overview and the deep-diving analysis to discover how to decrease emisssions quickly.

First of all, you can choose what is shown on the bar chart. The X Value and Y Value are the filters used to compare your asset consumption and the emissions released CO₂ equivalents, in tonnes.

![Bar chart filters](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelStack.png)

and you can select both the x value

![chart x value selection](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelXvalue.png)

and the y value.

![chart y value selection](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelYvalue.png)

To give an example, this is how the fuel data is displayed when stacked by asset and with x value as months and the y value as carbon equivalents in kg.

![Fuel consumption chart by assets](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelBarChartExample.png)

Another example: Here you have an overview which shows the type and amount of both diesel and petrol you are buying from different fuel suppliers.

![Overview chart comparing data from fuel suppliers](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelBarChartExample2.png)

Experiment with these feature as much as you like and ask our service team for assistance if you need it. We're here to help!

Choose the date range you want to look at

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityDateRange.png)

and select the unit for displaying the electricity consumption. You can view it in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or have us convert it into kilograms of carbon equivalents (kgCO2e) or tonnes of carbon equivalents (tCO2e).

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/+ElectricityUnit.png)

You can also select asset groups

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityAssetGroups.png)

or look at individual assets.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityIndividualAssets.png)

The analytics tools allow you to compare the energy consumption in different workstations and buildings, compare your electricity consumption over different monthts, quarters and years, and seek opportunities for improvements.

### Summary
